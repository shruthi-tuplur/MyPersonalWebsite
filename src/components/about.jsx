            <p> I started my career with a background in psychology and criminal justice 
                because I loved learning about how the society we live in shapes the way people think on a community scale, and I wanted to use that knowledge to see if I could use that knowledge to help make our
                world a more just and equitable world where people have equal access to resources necessary for thriving in our world. Growing up in Silicon Valley, I've seen firsthand
                how technology can help with that; for example, companies like Instacart help people with disabilities and chronic illnesses get groceries, and we've all seen how people can raise
                miraculous amounts of money for important causes using crowdfunding resources such as GoFundMe. I got into coding because technology is one of the best ways to help make changes on large scales
                because of the sheer amount of people with access to it, and I am very excited about the idea of working on projects that can positively impact an enormous scale of people.
            </p>
            <p> In my free time, I enjoy hanging out with my cat Cheese, crocheting, reading mystery novels, doing puzzles, visiting museums, and exploring the area with friends. My favorite tv show is Criminal Minds
                and I love hammerhead sharks, pineapple does NOT belong on pizza, and raisins do not belong anywhere.
